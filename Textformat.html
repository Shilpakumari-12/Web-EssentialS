Once upon a time, there was a king who kept a monkey as a pet.
The monkey served the king by all the possible ways.

<div>
It was very hos in those days. So one day, when the king was sleeping, monkey was fanning the king. Suddenly monkey noticed a fly on the chest of the king. The monkey tried to swish it away. But fly would go away for one moment and come back again.

The monkey then looked for something to hit a fly.
It then found a stick
It picked up the stick and tried to beat the fly using stick
Hmmm at last it found a fly and
with all the force it hit the ly as a result of which the king died.
